                    Sword missing from the shrine bonfire.
                    Cannot be equipped as a weapon.

                    Thrust into the shrine bonfire to restore its power and enable travel between bonfires.

                    This sword is only bequeathed to chosen ash, as judged by the Iudex, who awaits the arrival of ash as a scabbard.

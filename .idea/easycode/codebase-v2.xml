It loads the SQLite JDBC driver, then calls DriverManager.getConnection() to create the connection.\\n\\n- closeConnection(Connection connection) - Closes an existing database connection. It calls connection.close() and prints a message if closing is successful. Catches any SQLException errors. \\n\\n- It defines the database URL and file path as static constants (DB_URL, FULL_PATH).\\n\\nThe main purpose of this class is to encapsulate the database connection logic - opening and closing connections - so that other classes can simply call the static methods to get a Connection without having to deal with the JDBC driver and connection details directly. This makes connecting to the database simpler and cleaner for client code.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/XMLManagers/JDomManager.java\&quot;:\&quot;This JDomManager class is used to read, write and manipulate XML data using the JDOM library in Java.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- readXML() - Reads XML data from a file and returns a List of Boss objects populated from the XML\\n\\n- printXML() - Prints out the attributes of Boss objects read from an XML file \\n\\n- generateXML() - Takes a List of Boss objects and generates a new XML file containing them\\n\\n- createBossElement() - Creates a JDOM Element representing a Boss object \\n\\n- createElementWithText() - Helper method to create a JDOM Element with text content\\n\\n- getFilename() - Getter for the default XML filename constant\\n\\nThe class provides functionality to:\\n\\n- Read XML data from a file into Java objects\\n- Print out XML data \\n- Generate XML files from Java objects\\n\\nIt uses JDOM to work with XML documents and elements. The key methods handle reading, writing and transforming between XML and Java object representations of Boss entities.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/Entities/BossManager.java\&quot;:\&quot;This BossManager class is used to manage a list of Boss objects.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- getBossList() and setBossList() - Getter and setter for the bossList field, which stores the list of Boss objects.\\n\\n- addBoss(Boss, List) - Adds a Boss object to the given list. \\n\\n- showList(List) - Prints out details of each Boss in the given list.\\n\\n- createBossList() - Creates a new empty list, creates some sample Boss objects, adds them to the list using addBoss(), and returns the populated list.\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n- Stores and manages a list of Boss objects\\n- Allows adding/getting the boss list \\n- Prints details of bosses in a list\\n- Has a method to populate an initial boss list with sample data\\n\\nSo it provides the basic functionality to store, retrieve, print and initialize a list of boss enemies that could then be used elsewhere in the game code.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/XMLManagers/DomManager.java\&quot;:\&quot;This DomManager class provides methods for parsing, analyzing, and manipulating XML documents using the DOM (Document Object Model) API in Java.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- parseXML() - Parses the XML document stored in the file member variable and makes it ready for further processing.\\n\\n- getNumBosses() - Retrieves and prints the number of \\u003cboss\\u003e elements in the XML document. \\n\\n- printBossData() - Prints detailed information about each \\u003cboss\\u003e element by extracting data from child nodes.\\n\\n- readUnknownXML() - Reads and prints the content of all child nodes of \\u003cboss\\u003e elements without knowing the structure, to handle unknown XML.\\n\\n- newXML(category, constraint) - Creates a new XML document containing only \\u003cboss\\u003e elements that match the specified category and constraint. It filters the bosses, imports matching nodes, and writes the new XML to a file.\\n\\nIn summary, it provides methods to parse, analyze structure and content, extract data, and generate new XML documents from an existing one using DOM APIs in Java. This allows programmatic manipulation and querying of XML data.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/SQLite/SQLiteCRUD.java\&quot;:\&quot;This SQLiteCRUD.java file provides CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for a Boss entity using an SQLite database.\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- insertBoss() - Inserts a new Boss object into the database\\n- deleteBoss() - Deletes a Boss from the database by ID \\n- updateBoss() - Updates an existing Boss in the database by ID and field\\n- countBosses() - Counts the number of Bosses in the database\\n- getAllBosses() - Retrieves all Bosses from the database\\n- deleteAllBosses() - Deletes all Bosses from the database\\n- findBoss() - Finds the ID of a Boss by a field and match value\\n- displayBossTable() - Displays the contents of the Boss table\\n- displayColumnMetadata() - Displays metadata about the Boss table columns\\n- displayDatabaseInfo() - Displays general info about the database\\n- getConnection()/setConnection() - Gets/sets the database connection\\n\\nIt provides a complete CRUD interface to perform basic data operations on the Boss entity using prepared statements and by accessing the database metadata. The connection to the SQLite database is also managed through this class.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/XMLManagers/SaxManager.java\&quot;:\&quot;This SaxManager class is used to parse an XML file containing boss entity data using SAX (Simple API for XML) parsing.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructor that takes the XML file path and initializes the file object.\\n\\n- startElement() - Called when an XML element starts. Sets boolean flags to track the current element name. Prints out boss ID attribute if at \\u003cboss\\u003e element.\\n\\n- endElement() - Called when an XML element ends. Prints message for \\u003c/boss\\u003e\\n\\n- characters() - Called for character data between elements. Prints element values based on boolean flags set in startElement(). Resets flags. \\n\\n- getFile() - Gets the XML file being parsed.\\n\\nThe class extends DefaultHandler which implements callbacks for SAX parsing events like startElement, endElement, characters. It uses boolean flags to track the current element and print out the parsed data like boss name, location, stats etc. from the XML as it is parsed sequentially using SAX.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides SAX parsing of an XML file containing boss data and prints out the parsed values.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/XMLManagers/XMLTransformer.java\&quot;:\&quot;This XMLTransformer class provides a method to transform an XML document to HTML using an XSLT stylesheet.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- toHTML(): The main transformation method that takes the XML, XSLT and output HTML file paths as parameters.\\n\\n- It creates StreamSource objects for the XML and XSLT files. \\n\\n- Gets an instance of TransformerFactory to create a Transformer. \\n\\n- Applies the XSLT stylesheet to the Transformer by passing the XSLT StreamSource.\\n\\n- Creates a StreamResult for the output HTML file.\\n\\n- Calls transformer.transform() to apply the transformation from the XML to the XSLT stylesheet rules and output the result to the HTML file. \\n\\n- Handles any TransformerExceptions or IOExceptions that may occur during the transformation process.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a simple way to transform an XML file to HTML using an XSLT stylesheet by handling all the necessary JAXP API classes and transformation process under the hood.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/Entities/Boss.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a Boss class to represent boss entities in the game Dark Souls 3.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines attributes/fields to store boss data like ID, name, location, HP, poise, souls, drop item, description\\n\\n- Has different constructors to initialize a Boss object with full or partial data \\n\\n- Constructor for database use that doesn\\u0027t take ID\\n\\n- Getter and setter methods for each attribute to allow reading and updating boss data\\n\\n- Encapsulates boss entity data into a single class object\\n\\n- Provides a template/blueprint for creating Boss objects to represent individual bosses in the game\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructors to create Boss objects\\n- Getter methods to retrieve attribute values \\n- Setter methods to update attribute values\\n- Fields to store boss attribute data in an object\\n- Encapsulates boss data into a single class for object-oriented representation\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a Boss class that can be used to represent individual boss entities from the game by storing their data in objects conforming to this class template.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/bosses.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML file defines the bosses in Dark Souls 3. Some key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines the structure of boss data using XML tags like \\u003cbosses\\u003e, \\u003cboss\\u003e, \\u003cbossName\\u003e, etc. \\n\\n- Stores information about each boss like their ID, name, location, stats (HP, poise, souls awarded), and drop item.\\n\\n- There are 19 boss entries defined, each with a unique ID.\\n\\n- The stats and drop item for each boss is stored, along with descriptive text.\\n\\n- It provides all the data needed to display information about each boss, like in a wiki or game guide. \\n\\n- The XML structure and tags allow this boss data to be easily parsed and accessed programmatically.\\n\\n- Additional CSS/XSL stylesheets could be applied to transform and display the XML data nicely.\\n\\nSo in summary, the key functions of this file are to:\\n\\n1. Define the structure for storing boss data \\n2. Store all the detailed information about each Dark Souls 3 boss\\n3. Provide structured data that can be accessed and displayed in different formats\&quot;,\&quot;/src/Main.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Main.java file is the driver class that runs various tests and demonstrations of XML and SQLite functionality.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- DOMTest() - Demonstrates parsing and querying an XML file using DOM (Document Object Model)\\n- SAXTest() - Demonstrates parsing an XML file using SAX (Simple API for XML) \\n- JDOMTest() - Demonstrates parsing, generating, and querying XML using JDOM\\n- XSLTTest() - Demonstrates transforming an XML file to HTML using XSLT\\n- SQLiteTest() - Demonstrates CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a SQLite database including:\\n  - Connecting to the database\\n  - Inserting, updating, deleting bosses \\n  - Counting rows\\n  - Displaying table data and metadata\\n\\nThe main purpose of the file is to test and showcase the capabilities of the XMLManagers and SQLiteCRUD classes by running sample operations and queries on XML files and a SQLite database. It provides examples of common XML and database tasks like parsing, transforming, querying, and CRUD operations.\\n\\nThe different test methods allow exploring the functionality of DOM, SAX, JDOM and XSLT for XML as well as basic data access using SQLite.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/FileManager/FileManager.java\&quot;:\&quot;This FileManager.java file defines a FileManager class that can be used to manage files.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It is in the FileManager package\\n- The FileManager class is public, so it can be accessed from other classes\\n- No methods or fields are defined yet, this is just an empty class declaration\\n\\nSome key functions this class could potentially have based on its name:\\n\\n- Open/close files \\n- Read/write files\\n- Create/delete files\\n- Move/copy files\\n- Get file metadata like name, size, date\\n- Search for files\\n- Traverse directories \\n- Manage permissions\\n- Compress/extract files\\n\\nSo in summary, while this class currently doesn\\u0027t do anything, it lays the foundation for a FileManager class that could provide functions to programmatically manage files and file systems in Java. Additional methods would need to be implemented to give it actual file management capabilities.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
